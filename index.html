  <p>The Lansing Culinary Heritage Trail invites you to experience the culinary heritage of Michgan's capital city. 
    Food is central to the human experience. We have to eat and drink to sustain ourselves on a physiological level but 
    we also benefit from sharing meals and drinks with family and friends. Restaurants and bars are places where we can do all of the above. 
  On the Lansing Culinary Heritage Trail, you will learn about Lansing's history through stories surrounding the city's restaurants and 
    bars and their owners and workers. Follow the trail using the map below to learn more about Lansing's culinary past. You can learn from the website, 
  but you are encouraged to visit the locations in person.</p>
